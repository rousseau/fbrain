<div style="text-align: justify;" class="description"> Fbrain is a ERC funded project. The purpose
of this project is to develop image processing tools for a better
understanding of the fetal brain development. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Studies about brain maturation aim at providing a better
understanding of brain development and links between brain changes and
cognitive development. Such studies are of great interest for diagnosis
help and clinical course of development and treatment of illnesses.
Several teams have begun to make 3D maps of developing brain structures
from children to young adults. However, working out the development of
fetal and neonatal brain remains an open issue. This project aims at
jumping over several theoretical and practical barriers and at
going beyond the formal description of the brain maturation thanks to
the development of a realistic numerical model of brain aging. <br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BTK (baby brain toolkit),
which is the toolkit developed for the fbrain project, consists of
several image processing tools: image reconstruction, image denoising,
image segmentation, tractography etc.</p>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>Baby Brain Toolkit (BTK) depends on CMake, ITK, VTK, Tclap library
and OpenMP.</p>
<h2>Install</h2>
<p>Download the sources. Create a directory 'fbrain-build' (mkdir
fbrain-build), and then compile: <font size="-1"><br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">cd fbrain-build<br>
cmake ../fbrain<br>
make</font>
</p>
