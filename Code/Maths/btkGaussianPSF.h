/**
 * @brief Gaussian PSF represent a Gaussian PSF, the support is an image.
 * Sigma is computed with the spacing and the size of the image.
 * A common use of this class is :
 * - first construct the image with the correct parameters (center, size, spacing...)
 * - Get the Psf Image previously constructed
 * - iterate over the image to get the values
 *
 * NOTE : The Evaluate Method is currently not correct.
 * TODO : An Evaluate Method for compute the value of a point
 * (for example iterate over the image and break when the iterated point == point we wanted, then return the value of this point )
